# KISDI_BudgetReportManager

## Overview
This project focuses on managing and updating Excel files through an interactive user interface. The primary functionality includes dynamically adding new sheets to existing Excel files, as well as providing drag-and-drop capabilities in a Treeview for easier data manipulation. The aim is to simplify data management without the need to open the Excel file manually each time.

## Features
- **Dynamic Sheet Addition**: Add new sheets to an existing Excel file based on the file's original location, making it easier to expand and update data without overwriting or creating new files.
- **Drag-and-Drop Treeview**: Interactively update data and manage files using a drag-and-drop feature integrated into the Treeview UI, enhancing user experience and reducing manual steps.
- **Automatic Data Updates**: Modify and add data to Excel files automatically without the need to open the files through Excel, saving time and improving workflow efficiency.
- **Error Handling**: Handles scenarios such as attempting to modify a file that is already open in Excel, preventing accidental overwrites.
